## Getting Started

This repository has been freshly scaffolded following the-lodge conventions. The next session should:

1. **Read AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md** - Understand the project architecture
2. **Review planning/backlog.md** - See initial tasks
3. **Implement first converter** - Start with Spotify → Apple Music
4. **Set up development environment** - Create venv, install dependencies
5. **Test the FastAPI skeleton** - Verify the app runs

## Repository Structure

This project follows the-lodge conventions:
- `AGENTS.md` - Primary agent instructions (model-agnostic)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific guidance (redirects to AGENTS.md)
- `.githooks/commit-msg` - Delegates to the-lodge validator
- `planning/` - Task planning and progress tracking

See: `/Users/mriechers/Developer/the-lodge/conventions/` for all conventions.
